nsvn
=====
This command-line utility is useful for deleting an entire *svn* directory hierarchy from a root directory. 
This capability is especially appreciable under Windows since the the *dot* **.svn** files are not easy to manage. 
This component is part of the python library jld_.

Usage Example
-------------



 nsvn.py -F
